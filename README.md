# Hey there! I'm Vallari 🤖✨

I make robots for fun
Full-time curious cat, part-time student and robotics researcher


Currently exploring :
- 🧠 Robotic Perception & Sensor Fusion
- 🌐 Autonomous Navigation with ROS2
- ⚛️ Quantum-inspired AI systems


---

## 🔭 What I’m Working On
- Designing **perception algorithms** for autonomous systems at **DSRL**, on **Jetson Orin kits**
- Leading the **Technocrats Robotics** team through DD Robocon and International Rover Challenge
- Getting fluents in **ROS** , and its relative usage in robotics
- Building and testing custom robots for navigation, inspection, and crop health monitoring

---

## 💡 Why I Build
Nothing's more exciting than watching your code literally come to life:
- Designing **real-world usable systems**
- Bridging **mechanical design with intelligent algorithms**
- Making robotics more **accessible, reliable, and impactful**

---

## 🛠️ What I Use
**Languages**: Python, C++, SQL, JavaScript & their related libaries
**Frameworks**: ROS2, OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyTorch  
**Simulation Tools**: Gazebo, Isaac Sim  
**CAD/Hardware**: SolidWorks, Raspberry Pi, Arduino , Node MCUs
**Tools**: Docker, Git, MoveIt2, Qiskit

---

## 🧪 Projects & Explorations
- 🤖 **KIA** – An open-source robotic arm that goes from Bluetooth to autonomous gestures  
- 🛰️ **Field mapping Robot** – Field mapping & navigation using GPS + NAV2 stack
- 🌾 **Crop Disease Detection Bot** – Real-time analysis with YOLOv8, joystick fallback  
- 📱 **VITrace** – A full-stack lost-item tracking app that’s going live across campuses of VIT

---

## 🌱 Let’s Collaborate
Always open to learning from and building with other creators, researchers, and robotics nerds.
